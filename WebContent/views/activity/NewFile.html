<p class="MsoNormal">
	<em>&ldquo;Salut! I&rsquo;m Sheila Mondlane - the girl behind this
		magic. I&rsquo;m a Mozambican &lsquo;99&nbsp;</em><em>Leo baby. I have
		discovered in me a great passion for arts in its various form
		throughout the years since <strong>REPRESENT </strong>popped into my
		life as my entity. I admit that I had no passion for any of my craft
		when I started off but with the years of getting to learn about it
		&ndash; I have become dependent of the greats plans that come with it
		and a lover of each of their complexities.&rdquo;
	</em>
</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>What do I do right now? What am I known
			for?&nbsp;</em></strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m a blogger and fashion designer. If I am not
		mistaken it all started around the same phase in my life &ndash; I
		refer to the idea, the brainstorm not the execution &ndash; in Grade
		7, I was 12. I thought of the concept of my brand (still think through
		today) and started building each pillar that would support it on a day
		like today and actually a further future which I have not reached.</em>&rdquo;
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<strong>How did <em>REP</em> come about?
	</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<em>&ldquo;The blog started off as a random Tumblr page in which I
		just reposted</em> cool <em>pictures &ndash; but only black and white.
		Then, I had an idea with a friend that we&rsquo;d start a blog
		together around a time in which her and other friends in common, in
		our class had just read &rsquo;</em>Adorkable&rsquo;<em> by Sara
		Manning (funny, I only read after this) but that took a wrong turn and
		a downfall and challenged by my own fear to do things alone &ndash; I
		worked on making it as it is known today. I took and take my time to
		do research, reach out and then edit texts and media to make that
		final post. Unfortunately, in 2016, I was on a break due to my Matrics
		(Grade 12) which was time-consuming and I hated how inconsistent it
		made me. It was a huge sacrifice and pain for me.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<strong>You said you were a fashion designer, tell us about
		that.</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<em>&ldquo;As a fashion designer, summarizing, I debuted in the
		age of 14 given the chance to participate in</em> Mozambique Fashion Week<em>
		under the category of </em>MFW School.<em> <br />I was too young
		before. Since then I have never stopped trying and successfully
		earning a spot each year. Age has been the issue then money and I am
		pushing for a day in which I go in with the
	</em>big dogs<em> and shoot my talent for </em>MFW Young Designers<em>.
		Interest for fashion? Yes over the years. When I started I actually
		focused on portraits and tried drawing clothing out of boredom amidst
		classes in Grade 7. I got a compliment and </em>tada<em>. I started
		working on it and not only when I started participating in </em>MFW <em>and
		attending the various workshops, interacting with great designers,
		living that lifestyle and understanding its complexity did I develop
		that desire to be a fashion designer. I am one.&rdquo;</em>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<strong>Last but not least &hellip;</strong>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
	<em>&hellip; with <strong>REPRESENT</strong> I leave a brand and I
		live for it - to make it happen but also with <strong>REPRESENT</strong>,
		I seek to learn the complexity of several other arts and be inspired
		because then only does one get to appreciate the fruit of a
		human&rsquo;s creativity conveyed from within to others.<a
